Project Template for a Django project
=====================================

Creates a Django Project that is structured well, is an egg (ditributable),
 and works with minimal changes.

Included as dependencies by default:
* django-celery
* south
* html5boilerplate

It also splits the settingsup into core/dev/prod
It also includes 404.html and 500.html templates,
 since every project needs them.
It also includes a base_template based on html5boilerplate.
