Project Template for a Django project
=====================================

Creates a Django Project that is structured well, is an egg (ditributable),
 and works with minimal changes.

Included as dependencies by default:
* django-celery
* south

It also splits the settingsup into core/dev/prod
It also includes simple 404.html and 500.html templates,
 since every project needs them.



To create project:
------------------
django-admin.py startproject --template=https://github.com/grigi/project_template/zipball/master --name="*.py,MANIFEST.in" foo
cd foo
chmod +x manage.py

Please change the README file, as this is this is the templates README

Now just run:
./manage.py syncdb
./manage.py migrate
./manahe.py runserver



To add app:
-----------
cp -a app.sample bar

Add to foo/urls.py:
    url(r'^bar/', include('bar.urls')),

Add to foo/settings/common.py to the INSTALLED_APPS:
    'bar',

Update bar/urls.py to reflect the app name:
    urlpatterns = patterns('bar.views',

It automatically adds serving static content under static/
It automatically adds the templates to be processed
